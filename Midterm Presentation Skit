BEN: “HELLO, I'M BEN
THIS IS ABDULLAH, JERRY, AND JIALUN”

BEN: “AND THIS IS THE SMART BABY GUARD.”

ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 1) WHY BABY GUARD? OUR GOAL IS TO COMPLETELY ERADICACTE CHILD INJURIES IN THE HOME. WE BELIEVE THAT CURRENT PREVENTATIVE MEASURES ARE NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP ALL BABIES SAFE. NO PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE TO BURY THEIR CHILD.
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 2) LET’S TAKE A LOOK AT CHILD SAFETY, BY THE NUMBERS.
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 4) 3,000,000. KANSAS STATE REPORTS THAT 3,000,000 KIDS WERE TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR HOUSELHOLD INJURIES IN THE US ALONE.
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 3) 2,096. THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ALSO REPORTS THAT 2,096 KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 14 DIE FROM HOUSEHOLD INJURIES, WITH 80% OF THESE KIDS BEING UNDER THE AGE OF FOUR.

BEN: (SLIDE 1) FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE A SOLUTION. THE SMART BABY GUARD.
BEN: (SLIDE 2) AS SHOWN ON THIS DIAGRAM, OUR SOLUTION ALLOWS US TO DESIGNATE SAFE ZONES WITHIN THE HOME. USING IR SENSORS AND A SPARK CORE, OUR PRODUCT CAN DIFFERENTIATE YOUR BABY FROM OTHERS. WHENEVER HE/SHE LEAVES THE SAFE ZONE, THE SYSTEM WILL ACTIVATE, SENDING AN ALERT TO THE PARENTS' INTERNET ENABLED DEVICES.

ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 1) WHAT HAVE WE DONE SO FAR?
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 2) SO FAR WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE EARLY STAGES OF THE ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS, INCLUDING RESEARCH, PROBLEM STATEMENT, AND BRAINSTORMING.
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 3) WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO DESIGN A PROTOTYPE, AND ORDERED THE NECESSARY MATERIALS TO MAKE A FUNCTIONING MODEL. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CREATED A MOCK APPLICATION THAT SIMULATES THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCT.

BEN MA: (SLIDE 1) SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
BEN MA (SLIDE 2) OUR NEXT GOAL IS TO TAKE OUR DESIGN FROM THE PAPER TO REAL WORLD. WE AIM TO HAVE A FULLY FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE BY THE END OF THIS SEMESTER.
BEN MA: (SLIDE 3) WE ALSO PLAN TO RESEARCH THE MARKET USING SURVEYS TO DETERMINE THE BEST WAY TO GET OUR PRODUCT OUT INTO THE WORLD.
BEN MA: (SLIDE 4) IN THE FUTURE, WE HOPE TO ADD MORE FUNCTIONALITY BASED ON CONSUMER INTEREST SUCH AS A BUILT IN BABY MONITOR OR AN AUTOMATED BABY GATE LOCK.

ABDULLAH: THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION! FEEL FREE TO STOP US AFTER CLASS AND ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
