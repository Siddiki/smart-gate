SMART BABY GUARD FINAL PRESENTATION SCRIPT
ABDULLAH: HELLO, I'M ABDULLAH. THIS IS BEN, JERRY, AND JIALUN”
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 1) AND THIS IS THE SMART BABY GUARD, AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION FOR BABY SAFETY. 
SIMPLY INSTALL THE DEVICE ON YOUR BABY’S BEDROOM DOOR, AND ALLOW THE SMART BABY GUARD TO DO THE REST. THE DEVICE WILL RECOGNIZE ANY TIME YOUR CHILD LEAVES THE BEDROOM AND SEND AN ALERT DIRECTLY TO YOUR SMART PHONE, TABLET, OR COMPUTER.
BEN: (SLIDE 2): SO HOW DOES OUR PRODUCT WORK? THE SMART BABY GUARD USES TWO INTELLIGENTLY PLACED INFRARED SENSORS THAT WILL IDENTIFY A CHILD LEAVING THE ROOM. ONCE THE SENSOR IS ACTIVATED, THE SPARK CORE WILL ALERT THE PARENTS.
ABDULLAH: (Slide 3) BUT A FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT IS USELESS IF NO ONE WANTS IT. SO WE LAUNCHED A FAKE BETA. TO COLLECT OUR DATA, WE BUILT A WEBSITE, DISTRIBUTED A FLYER, AND SURVEYED POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS.
BEN MA:  (SLIDE 4) THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS CREATE A WEBSITE TO EASILY SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT. WE INTRODUCED USERS BY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM, EXPLAINING OUR UNIQUE SOLUTION, AND ESTABLISHING CREDIBILITY. WE ALSO EMBEDDED A FORM ON THE WEBSITE FOR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS TO SIGN UP FOR THE BETA.
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 5) WE KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE IS AS EXPOSED TO THE INTERNET, SO WE DESIGNED A FLYER AND PLACED IT IN LOCATIONS THAT POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS SUCH AS PARENTS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN WOULD FIND IT. THE FLYER CONTAINS A CODE THAT ALLOWS US TO DETERMINE WHERE THEY CAME FROM, AND DETMERINE WHETHER OR NOT THE LOCATION WAS A VIABLE PLACE TO GATHER CUSTOMERS.
BEN MA: (SLIDE 6) IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, AND GATHER THEIR OPINION, WE SENT OUT A MASS EMAIL TO THOSE WHO SIGNED UP FOR THE BETA, ASKING THEM TO TAKE OUR SURVEY. THE SURVEY AIMS TO GIVE US INFORMATION ABOUT THE PUBLIC OPINION OF OUR PRODUCT. 
ABDULLAH: (SLIDE 7) ANOTHER PROMISING POTENTIAL MEDIA OUTLET FOR US TO UTILIZE TO SPREAD OUR IDEA WAS THE INTERNET COMMUNITY OF BLOG READING MOTHERS. WE FOUND THERE WAS A HUGE COMMUNITY OF MOTHERS WHO RUN BLOGS WITH THOUSANDS OF READERS. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DIDN’T PAN OUT BECAUSE MOST OF THESE BLOGS WANTED A SPONSORSHIP FEE TO BLOG ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS.
BEN MA: (SLIDE 8)WE ALSO TALKED TO OUR OWN PARENTS TO SHARE THE SURVERY WITH THEIR FRIENDS, WHO WERE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO HAVE KIDS THAN OUR OWN FRIENDS. WE LEARNED TO TAKE THIS DATA WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BECAUSE THOSE CLOSE TO US WILL GENERALLY GIVE US BIASED ANSWERS.
(SLIDE 9) WE ALSO TRIED TO REACH OUT DIRECTLY TO MOTHERS BY GOING TO BABYSRUS AND KINDERGARTENS
BEN MA:  (SLIDE 10) WE USED GOOGLE ANALYTICS TO FIND OUT WHO WE WERE REACHING AND HOW WE WERE REACHING THEM. WE LOOKED AT DATA SUCH AS BOUNCE RATE, SITE TRAFFIC, AND USER LOCATIONS.
(SLIDE 11) WE ALSO LEARNED A LOT FROM THE SURVEY, WHICH OFFERED DIRECT FEEDBACK FROM POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS.
ABDULLAH: FROM GOOGLE ANALYTICS, WE FOUND THAT MOST OF OUR WEBSITE HITS WERE GENERATED FROM SOCIAL MEDIA SITES, NAMELY FACEBOOK. WE ALSO SAW THAT A LARGE PORTION OF WEBSITE VISITORS WERE BOUNCING IN A REALLY SHORT SPAN OF TIME.
BEN MA: FROM THE SURVEY WE SAW A LOT OF RESPONSES SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE PRODUCT. THIS MEANS THAT THEY LIKED THE IDEA, BUT IT ALSO TOLD US THAT OUR WEBSITE WAS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH IN CONVEYING INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCT
ABDULLAH: BASED ON OUR MARKET RESEARCH, WE THIS IS HOW WE WOULD IMPROVE OUR MARKET VIABILITY IN THE FUTURE.
IN REGARDS TO THE PRODUCT, WE WOULD TRY TO MAKE IT MORE COST EFFICIENT AND ADD A BABY GATE LOCKING SYSTEM. THESE WERE RECURRING RESPONSES FROM OUR SURVEY.
YINGFU MA: IN REGARDS TO MARKETING, WE WOULD MAKE A BETTER WEBSITE WITH MORE INFORMATION AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF OUR DEVICE. WE WOULD ALSO INVEST SOME MONEY IN GETTING IT ONTO THE BLOGOSPHERE TO GET EVEN MORE RESPONSES AND CREATE A BUZZ
ABDULLAH: THANK YOUR FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION! FEEL FREE TO STOP US AND ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
