KICKSTARTER VIDEO SCRIPT

****COOL MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND****

BEN'S VOICE, *SHOTS OF KIDS AND STUFF*: 

HEY KICKSTARTER, MY NAME IS BEN, AND THIS IS JERRY, ABDULLAH AND JIALUN. WE'RE A TEAM OF ENGINEERS WHO CREATED THE SMART BABY GUARD. SO WHY BABY GUARD? WELL,

THE KANSAS STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT REPORTS THAT 3,000,000 KIDS WERE TAKEN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR HOUSELHOLD INJURIES IN THE US ALONE. OF THOSE, 2,096 KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 14 WILL DIE FROM THOSE INJURIES. WITH 80% OF THESE KIDS BEING UNDER THE AGE OF FOUR.

WHILE BABY GATES CAN BE EFFECTIVE, THEY ARE NOT FOOLPROOF. PEOPLE ARE FORGETFUL AND LEAVE GATES OPEN. SOMETIMES BABIES FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPEN THE GATES, AND IT IS INEFFICIENT AND EXPENSIVE TO BUY BABY GATES FOR EVERY ROOM, MEDICINE CABINET, AND STAIRCASE. 
PICS OF BABYGUARD
JUST PLACE THE SMART BABY GUARD WHEREVER YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO BE SAFE. IF YOUR CHILD EVER LEAVES THE SAFE ZONE, YOU WILL RECIEVE A NOTIFICATION TO YOUR SMART PHONE, TABLET, OR COMPUTER, ALLOWING YOU TO QUICKLY GO AND PROTECT YOUR CHILD.
DEMO
THE BABY GUARD INTUITIVELY USES TWO IR SENSORS TO DETECT WETHER THE PERSON PASSING THE GATE IS A CHILD OR ADULT. IT THEN COMMUNICATES OVER THE INTERNET USING AN INTERNET ENABLED MICROCONTROLLER CALLED THE SPARK CORE TO ALERT THE PARENT.
SHOTS OF US WORKING
*SHOT OF US AT A TABLE OR SOMETIHNG* 
WHILE WE HAVE A WORKING PROTOTYPE, WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE WE CAN TAKE THIS PRODUCT TO THE MARKET. WE'VE ALREADY COMPLETED A FAKE BETA, AND GATHERED DATA ON OUR PRODUCT. WE WANT TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP IN IMPLEMENTING AN AUTOMATED LOCKING SYSTEM TO KEEP ANY DOORS YOU WANT CLOSED CLOSED. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU, KICKSTARTER. EVERY DOLLAR YOU BACK TODAY IS ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS KEEPING THE NEXT GENERATION SAFE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO BRINGING YOU THE SMART BABY GUARD.
